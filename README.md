# GeminiFlow Chrome Extension

## Overview

The GeminiFlow Chrome Extension is designed to streamline the workflow for web developers by integrating with the Gemini tool from Google. This extension allows users to resolve programming errors and obtain more useful responses through four different workflow techniques for LLM agents.

## Features

- **Error Information Input:** Users can copy and paste programming error information, provide context, and select interaction options within a web form.
- **Workflow Execution:** The extension executes the workflow and opens the Gemini tool, where it inputs the code and retrieves the desired response.
- **Four Workflow Techniques:** Based on the techniques demonstrated in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIcFlsIez_Q), the extension incorporates four distinct workflow methods for LLM agents.
- **User Experience:** Evaluation criteria include the ease of entering information, interacting with the LLM, and the format of the response.
- **Optional Publishing:** The extension can be published, although the evaluation does not include this aspect due to the 30-day publication process.
